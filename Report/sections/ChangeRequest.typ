= Change Request

For the change request redo and undo functioanllity was choosen,
the purpose is to give an user the ability to undo and/or redo actions getting them back to a "good" state.
Undo and redo are effectivly two "sub features", but as they both share simmilair functioanllity they are
grouped together under one change feature request.

The user story is formulated as follows:

#align(center)[
  #block(
    fill: luma(230),
    inset: 8pt,
    radius: 4pt,
    [As a user, i want the ability to undo and redo my actions so that i can recover from mistakes
    and return to a previous working state.]
  )
]
